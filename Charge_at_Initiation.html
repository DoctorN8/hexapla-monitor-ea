The greatest Monarchs in all Ages, as well of Asia and Africa as of Europe, have been Encouragers of the Royal Art; and many of them have presided as Grand-Masters over the Masons in their respective Territories, not thinking it any lessening to their Imperial Dignities to Level themselves with their Brethren in MASONRY, and to act as they did.<br>The World's great Architect is our Supreme Master, and the unerring Rule he has given us, is that by which we Work.<br>Religious Disputes are never suffered in the Lodge; for as MASONS, we only pursue the universal Religion or the Religion of Nature. This is the Cement which unites Men of the most different Principles in one sacred Band, and brings together those who were the most distant from one another.<br>There are three general Heads of Duty which MASONS ought always to inculcate, viz. to God, our Neighbours, and ourselves.<br>To God, in never mentioning his Name but with that Reverential Awe which becomes a Creature to bear to his Creator, and to look upon him always as the Summum Bonum which we came into the World to enjoy; and according to that View to regulate all our Pursuits.<br>To our Neighbours, in acting upon the Square, or doing as we would be done by.<br>To ourselves, in avoiding all intemperances and Excesses, whereby we may be rendered incapable of following our Work, or led into Behaviour unbecoming our laudable Profession, and in always keeping within due Bounds, and free from all Pollution.<br>In the State, a MASON is to behave as a peaceable and dutiful Subject, conforming cheerfully to the Government under which he lives.<br>He is to pay a due Deference to his Superiors, and from his Inferiors he is rather to receive Honour with some Reluctance, than to extort it.<br>He is to be a Man of Benevolence and Charity, not sitting down contented while his Fellow Creatures, but much more his Brethren, are in Want, when it is in his Power (without prejudicing himself or Family) to relieve them.<br>In the Lodge, he is to behave with all due Decorum, lest the Beauty and Harmony thereof should be disturbed or broke.<br>He is to be obedient to the Master and presiding Officers, and to apply himself closely to the<br>Business of Masonry, that he may the sooner become a Proficient therein, as well for his own Credit as the Honour of the Lodge.<br>He is not to neglect his own necessary Avocations for the sake of Masonry, nor to involve himself in Quarrels with those who through Ignorance may speak evil of, or ridicule it.<br>He is to be a Lover of Silence and Peace, and to show that he has stood to good Effect the first great Precept, to be ever ready to give Honour to whom it is due, and to avoid taking Offence, but readily to forgive Injuries.<br>Thus shall the Society flourish, and the Members thereof be happy and united.<br>And may that Almighty Being who is a Lover of Peace and Harmony, and who has promised that where two or three are gathered together in his Name, he will be in the Midst of them, bless us in all our undertakings.</td>

No society was ever raised on a better principle or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down, than are inculcated on all persons when initiated into the mysteries of this science. Monarchs, in all ages, have been encouragers and promoters of this Art, and have never deemed it derogatory from their dignity to level themselves with the fraternity, to extend their privileges, and to patronize their assemblies.]<br><br>As a gentleman and a mason you are bound to be a strict observer of the moral law, as contained in this holy book*; to consider it as the unerring standard of truth and justice, and to regulate your life and actions by its divine precepts. Herein your duty to God†, to your neighbour‡, and to yourself§, is duly inculcated; and your zealous attachment to these duties will secure both public and private esteem.<br><br>In the state, you are to be a quiet and peaceable subject, true to your sovereign, and just to your country; never to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but patiently to submit to magisterial authority, and conform with cheerfulness to the government of the kingdom in which you live.<br><br>[In your outward demeanour you are to be particularly careful to avoid censure or reproach; and to beware of all those who may artfully endeavour to insinuate themselves into your esteem, with a view to betray your virtuous resolutions, or make you swerve from the honourable principles of this institution.

[The inconceivable pleasure of contributing towards the relief of our fellow-creatures can only be experienced by persons of a humane disposition, who are naturally excited, by the power of sympathy to extend their aid in alleviation of the miseries of others. This alone encourages the generous soul to distribute his bounty with cheerfulness. By supposing himself in their unhappy situation, he listens to their complaints with attention, bewails their misfortunes, and speedily relieves their distress.]<br><br>The next object of your attention, and which more immediately relates to your present state, is our excellent Book of Constitutions.

No institution was ever raised on better principles, or on a more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent rules and useful maxims laid down than those, which are inculcated on all persons initiated into our mysteries.<br><br>Monarchs, in all ages, have been patrons of this art, and many of them have presided as grand masters, deeming it no derogation from their dignities, to put themselves...<br><br>On this side of the Atlantic, which may, in some respects, be called a new world, the immortal Washington, the illustrious Franklin, the brave general Warren, and many more of our most celebrated revolutionary characters, too tedious to be mentioned, were of this institution most distinguished members; and I have the pleasure to add, that many of the most eminent statesmen, who have been since called to guide the destinies of this rising empire, have not only been members of our society; but have delighted in exerting themselves to the utmost, to promote its honour and best interests.<br><br>The world's great architect is our supreme master, and the unerring rule, which he has given to every one, I mean the light of conscience, is the rule by which we ought invariably to work.<br><br>There are three great duties, which masons ought not only to perform themselves; but likewise, to inculcate, as far as possible, on their friends and acquaintances, viz. their duty to God, their neighbours, and themselves.<br><br>1. To God. In never mentioning his sacred name, unless with that reverential awe, which is due from a creature to his creator; whom we ought to adore, as the source of all happiness, not only in the present, but also, in that future world, which is beyond death and the grave; whom we ought always to have in view, as our chief good, and whose blessing we ought to implore, on all our laudable undertakings.<br><br>2. To your neighbours, you are to act upon the square, i.e. you are to follow the golden rule of doing to others, as, in similar circumstances, you would wish that they should do to you.<br><br>3. As it respects yourself, you are to avoid intemperance and excess of every kind, whereby you may be rendered incapable of following your work or prosecuting the duties of your profession, or by which you may be led into behaviour unbecoming of our order. You are, likewise, to labour diligently in your vocation; for "he, who doth not work, should not eat," and "he, who is slothful in work, is brother to him who is a great waster."<br><br>In the state you are to be a quiet and peaceable citizen. You are never to countenance treason or rebellion; but to submit yourself, on every occasion disposed to act in conformity to the laws, constitution, and government of the country, in which you live, and to induce others, as far as may be in your power, to act in the same manner.<br><br>In your intercourse with the world, you are to be particularly careful, to act in such a manner as that you may avoid censure or reproach.<br><br>Let not interest, favour, or partiality to any individual, bias your integrity, or influence you to be guilty of a dishonourable action; of which you might afterwards have cause to repent; but let your whole conduct be such as will ensure you the testimony of a good conscience towards God and towards man.<br><br>Be eminent for the practice of benevolence and charity, which may with great propriety be considered as the distinguishing characteristic of this venerable institution.<br><br>You are carefully to study the principles, and endeavour to excel in all the virtues of the craft.<br><br>A punctual attendance at every meeting of the lodge is required. Your improvement and your happiness will, thereby, be greatly promoted. Yet masonry must not interfere with your necessary employments; for these are, on no account, to be neglected. At your leisure, it is expected that you will apply to such brethren as are skilled in the mystic art, whom you will find to be fully as ready to give, as you to receive instruction.<br><br>You are to endeavour to improve in useful knowledge. Here no reflection is intended upon you. But it may be safely asserted, that the wisest of us have much to learn, and that when a man thinks himself perfect in any art, science, or profession, all hopes of his improvement may, in general, be considered as vain. But of you, my brother, we entertain the most sanguine expectations, and doubt not that by your industry, perseverance, and good conduct, you will become an useful member of this lodge and an honour to the craft.<br><br>If, in the circle of your acquaintance, you should find one, who may be desirous of being received into our society, you are by no means to recommend him unless you be convinced, that he will conform to our rules, so that the honour and reputation of our institution may not be tarnished, and that the world, at large may be satisfied with respect to its benign influence.<br><br>Finally, You are to keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of the order, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence amongst the fraternity.<br><br>Brother, we bid you a sincere welcome to all the pleasures of this affectionate and happy fraternity.</td>

Ancient, as having existed from time immemorial; honorable, as tending to make all men so who are strictly obedient to its precepts. It is an Institution having for its foundation the practice of the social and moral virtues. And to so high an eminence has its credit been advanced, that in every age and country, men pre-eminent for their moral and intellectual attainments have encouraged and promoted its interests.

To God, by never mentioning his name, but with that awe and reverence which are due from the creature to his Creator; by imploring his aid on all your lawful undertakings, and by looking up to him in every emergency, for comfort and support. To your neighbor, by acting with him upon the square; by rendering him every kind office which justice or mercy may require; by relieving his distresses, and soothing his afflictions; and by doing to him, as in similar cases, you would that he should do unto you. And to yourself, by such a prudent and well-regulated course of discipline, as may best conduce to the preservation of your corporeal and mental faculties in their fullest energy; thereby enabling you to exert the talents wherewith God has blest you, as well to his glory, as to the welfare of your fellow creatures.<br><br>As a Citizen, you are enjoined to be exemplary in the discharge of your civil duties, by never proposing or countenancing any act which may have a tendency to subvert the peace and good order of society; by paying due obedience to the laws under whose protection you live, and by never losing sight of the allegiance due to your country.<br><br>As an individual, you are charged to practice the domestic and public virtues. Let Temperance chasten, Fortitude support, Prudence direct you, and Justice be the guide of all your actions. Be especially careful to maintain, in their fullest splendor, those truly Masonic ornaments, which have already been amply illustrated—Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth.<br><br>Finally: Be faithful to the trust committed to your care, and manifest your fidelity to your principles, by a strict observance of the constitutions of the Fraternity; by adhering to the ancient landmarks of the Order; and by refraining to recommend any one to a participation in our privileges, unless you have strong grounds to believe that, by a similar fidelity, he will ultimately reflect honor on our ancient Institution.</td>

                <td class="text-content">You are now initiated into the first principles of Masonry, and we offer you our congratulations upon being accepted a Fellow into our ancient and honorable Order. Ancient, as having subsisted from time immemorial—and honorable, because its tendency is to render all men such, who act in conformity to its precepts. No institution was ever raised upon better principles, or established upon a more permanent foundation. The several lectures appertaining to this degree will now of course occupy some of your attention; at all convenient times, in order that you may improve therein, it will be your duty to converse with well-informed brethren, who will cheerfully communicate to you the required instruction.<br>As a Mason, there are three great duties which you are charged to inculcate: they are the duties which you owe to God, your neighbor, and yourself. To God, in never mentioning his sacred name, but with that reverential awe which is due from a creature to his creator; to implore his gracious favor upon all your laudable undertakings, and ever to esteem him the chief good. To your neighbor, in always acting with him upon the square, and in all your dealings, your communications, and your intercourse, doing unto him as, under similar circumstances, you would desire him to do unto you. To yourself, in cultivating every social virtue, in avoiding all irregularity and intemperance, and shunning every object which has a tendency to impair your faculties, or debase the dignity of your profession.<br>In the State, you are to be a quiet and peaceable subject, true to your country, and just to your government. You are not to countenance disloyalty or rebellion, but must patiently submit to the magisterial authority of the land in which you live.<br>In your intercourse with your Masonic brethren, you are to cultivate a forgiving and charitable disposition, and while in attendance at the Lodge, you must always regard it as a place sacred to friendship and brotherly love, where none but the most affectionate feelings are to be cherished and practiced.<br>The Great Architect of the Universe is our Supreme Governor and Master, and by the unerring rule he has given us, we are bound to regulate our work. Political and religious disputes are never tolerated within the Lodge. As Masons, we proscribe no man for opinion's sake, and recognize no sectarian creed. We follow the religion of truth and virtue, and this is the common center, around which are congregated, in one holy, indivisible bond of brotherhood, men of every tribe, and nation, and kindred, and tongue, under heaven.<br>Although your frequent attendance at our meetings is a matter of duty, yet it is not intended that you should ever on that account neglect your customary avocations; on the contrary, it is strictly enjoined upon you always faithfully and punctually to perform your daily work.<br>You are not, upon any occasion, to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into quarrels or fruitless arguments with those whom prejudice or ignorance may cause to abuse it. Provided you live up to the principles of Masonry, your own actions will constitute a "living epistle" that will be its most eloquent defense.<br>Our ancient and time-honored CONSTITUTIONS you are to search and study with particular care, as they contain the fundamental rules and regulations for the government of the fraternity in all parts of the world.<br>We seriously admonish you ever to keep sacred and inviolable the mysteries of our Order, as these are the criteria to distinguish you from the rest of the community, and mark your consequence among Masons.<br>If, within the circle of your acquaintance, you discover a friend desirous to be introduced among us, you must be cautious not to recommend him, until you are convinced he will conform to all our requirements, to the end that the honor and reputation of the institution may be fully sustained, and the world at large convinced of its beneficial effects.<br>You have, upon this occasion, taken an eventful step in your journey of life; you have entered upon the threshold of our mystic temple, and are now bound by the indissoluble ties of fraternity with many thousands of your fellow beings, all of whom have participated in the same ceremonies, and traveled the same road with yourself; but it is only upon the threshold that you stand. There are yet many apartments to be explored, the doors of which are strictly guarded, and are opened to none but those who come "duly and truly prepared," and are "well recommended."<br>In your outward demeanor, then, be particularly careful to avoid censure and reproach; let neither interest, nor favor, nor prejudice, bias your integrity, or influence you under any circumstances to be guilty of a dishonorable action.<br>Finally, BROTHER, keep it always in mind, that we are all probationers and sojourners here, and that if we would hereafter participate in the high and glorious mysteries of the CELESTIAL LODGE, we must so work agreeably to our moral trestle board as to meet the approbation of HIM who is a spirit of immaculate purity, and must be worshiped in spirit and truth.</td>
