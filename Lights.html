There was one in the East, another in the West, and another in the South, to light the men to, at, and from labor; but there was none in the North, because the sun darts no rays from thence. These constitute the symbolic situations of the three chief officers.

The Master's place is in the East, to call the brethren to labor; the Junior Warden is placed in the South, to cheer and encourage them at their work; and the Senior Warden in the West, to dismiss them from their daily toil.<br><br>This description of a Masonic Lodge will be found to embrace a perfect picture of the universe, both in its attributes and its extent.
