The apron with which we are clothed, indicates a disposition of innocence, and belies not the wearer's heart. Let the ignorant deride and scoff on; superior to the ridicule and malice of the wicked, we will enfold ourselves in the garb of our own virtue, and safe in self-approving conscience, stand unmoved amidst the persecutions of adversity.<br><br>To be a true Mason, is to possess this principle: or the apparel which he wears is an infamy to the apostate, and only shows him forth to shame and contempt.</td>
