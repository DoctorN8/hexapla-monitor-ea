Masonry consists of a course of ancient hieroglyphics, moral instructions taught agreeably to ancient usages by types, emblems and allegorical figures. Even the ceremonies of gaining admission, within these walls are emblematic of events which all mankind must sooner or later experience. They are emblematic at least in some small degree of your great and last change, of your exit from this world, to the world to come. You are undoubtedly aware that whatever man may acquire on earth, whether wealth, honor, titles or even his own merits, can never serve him as a passport to the Grand Lodge above, but previous to his gaining admission there, he must find himself poor and penniless, blind and naked dependent on the will and pleasure of the Supreme Grand Master. He must be divested of the rags of his own righteousness and clothed with a garment from on high. And in order to impress this more deeply on your mind it will be necessary that you be divested of a portion of your outward apparel and clothed in a garment furnished by the Worshipful Master of this Lodge, a garment similar to that worn by all candidates who have gone this way before you.<br><br>Are you willing to submit to these rules? (Candidate answer.)</td>

Freemasonry is a system of moral instruction anciently taught by types, symbols and allegorical figures. Even the ceremony of gaining admission is symbolical of an event which we must all sooner or later experience. You are doubtless aware that whatever a man may possess on earth, whether it be title, wealth, honor, or even “a good reputation” will not gain him admission into the Celestial Lodge above, but, before gaining admission there, he must become poor and penniless, blind and naked, entirely dependent upon the sovereign will of the Supreme Grand Master above</td>
