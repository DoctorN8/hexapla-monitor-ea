From the situation of this rude fabric, in early ages of the world, King Solomon adopted it as the ground plan of his more magnificent structure the Temple of Jerusalem; a pattern of symmetry and proportion, begun, carried on, and completed, under the auspices of a sovereign, whose regal splendour and unparalleled lustre have almost surpassed idea.

Give me the first!<br>The sun first took rise in the east and spread its divine influence in the west.<br><br>119. {T}here is a second reason!<br>Evangelical and moral knowledge was first preached in the east and propagated in the west.<br><br>120. There is a third and last grand reason.<br>The happy Deliverance of the CHILDREN of ISRAEL, from their EGYPTIAN BONDAGE. (Exodus, Ch. 13, 14, 15, 19.) From the earliest PERIOD, Mankind ever had the most convincing Proofs of the Existence of a Supreme BEING. Yet, from the most Ancient and best Historians, we do not find it Recorded, that any Place was set apart for worshipping the true GOD, till after the deliverance of the Children of Israel from their Egyptian bondage, when the Time was then at hand, that the ALMIGHTY revealed Himself amongst Men, in so wonderful a Manner, that made his Name glorious throughout all Nations.<br><br>He did not lead the Children of Israel through the land of the Philistines, although a much nearer Way, but through the Wilderness, wherein he shewed his great Wisdom and Mercy, as the spirit of Liberty being yet in Embryo, their Hearts might fail them, at the Appearance of so warlike a People as the Philistines, and they return to their former Slavery.<br><br>He therefore commanded his faithful Servant Moses, to conduct them through the Wilderness to the Borders of the Red-Sea, in their way to the promised Land, which made Pharaoh, King of Egypt regret, that he had let so many useful Slaves, “as he was pleased to term Them,” depart his Dominions, that he ordered six hundred chosen Chariots to attend him, with all the Chariots and Captains that were in Egypt, for he was determined to bring them back to their former Captivity, or perish in the Attempt, and in his Pursuit, he overtook them beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.<br><br>The Children of Israel finding themselves hem’d in, by the Red Sea in the Front, the unpassable Mountains on the Right and Left, and the Egyptian Army in the Rear, Fear overcame them, and in their Despair, they murmered sorely against MOSES, “Saying”, why hast thou brought us here to be Slain in the Wilderness? were there not Graves sufficient for our Interment in Egypt?<br><br>When MOSES spake with Comfort unto them, and told them to fear Nothing, for on that Day they should observe the Salvation of the LORD {who} would fight for them; and in order to prove his Assertion, he, by GOD’s Command, stretched forth his sacred Hand over the Waves of the Read-Sea, which caused a strong Easterly Wind to blow, which divided the Waters, so that they were apparently a Wall on each side, while the Children of Israel marched through on dry Ground.<br><br>Pharaoh perceiving this, his Heart was hardened, and he attempted to follow them, but the ALMIGHTY continued his Protection, by a miraculous Pillar, which had two wonderful Effects, one was of Light to the Israelites by Night, to conduct them through the Red-Sea, and the other as a Pillar of Cloud and Smoke by Day, which was Darkness to the Egyptians, and prevented their Pursuit; he also sent a further Plague, amongst them, for with a mighty Hand and out-stretched Arm, he sent an Angel by Night, to strike off their Chariot Wheels, that they drave them so heavily, that the two Armies came not together all that Night.<br><br>When Morning-dawn appeared, Pharaoh perceiving the Hand of GOD working sorely against him, attempted to return, but it was then too late, for by that Time the Israelites had gained the opposite Shore, when Moses desired them to look back upon their long dreaded Enemy the Egyptians, for from that Time they should see them no More; he then by GOD’s Command, stretched forth his Sacred Hand a second Time over the Read-Sea, which caused the Waters to return into their primitive Channels, and over-whelmed Pharaoh, and all his Host.<br><br>And in Commemoration of so happy and glorious a Deliverance, Moses marched the Children of Israel three Days into the Wilderness, singing Hymns, Praises and Thanksgivings to the most High; and they also erected a Tent, or Tabernacle in the Wilderness, agreeable to the Plan, given to Moses, on Mount Sinai; which afterwards proved to be the MODEL or Ground-Plan of that Magnificent Temple, built at Jerusalem, by King Solomon, with such regal Splendor, and unparalleled refulgent Lustre, far surpassing all our Ideas.<br><br>This is the third and last grand reason, why all places of divine worship as well as regular{ly} constituted lodges are or ought to be situated due east and west.<br><br>The First BUILDING, Set Apart for Divine WORSHIP.<br>[Genesis, Ch. 4, 6, 12 {= 32}. Exodus, Ch. 13, 20. 1st. Kings, Ch. 8.]<br><br>Whenever we Contemplate on the Divine Wisdom of the CREATOR by the glorious works of the Creation, and all Things created Therein and Thereon; how ready and chearful ought we to be, to admire the wise disposer of Providence, who, from the earliest Period, never left himself without a living Witness amongst Men.<br><br>We read of Abel bringing an acceptable Offer to the LORD; of Noah being a just and upright Man, who walked humbly with GOD in his Generation; and Jacob wrestling with an Angel, and prevailing, whereby he obtained a Blessing; but we never heard of any Place being set Apart for the Solemnization of Divine Worship, untill after the happy Deliverance of the Children of Israel, from their heavy State of Slavery and Bondage in Egypt, when it pleased the LORD, to bring them forth, with a high Hand and out-stretched Arm, under his faithful Servant Moses.<br><br>And as the Israelites were to become a great and mighty People, and possess the Gates of their Enemy; the LORD thought fit to reveal to them, the two following Institutions; “Namely”, the Moral Ceremonial, and Judicial Laws; and for the better Solemnization of Divine Worship, a Repository of the Tables of the LAWS, a TENT or TABERNACLE was constructed in the Wilderness, which afterwards proved to be the MODEL, or GROUND-PLAN, of that Magnificent Temple, built by KING SOLOMON, at Jerusalem.<br><br>---</td>

Since that time, every well regulated and governed Lodge is, or ought to be so situated.</td>

                <td class="text-content">How is the Lodge situated?<br>The Lodge is situated due East and West.<br><br>Why so?<br>Because all places of Divine worship, as well as all well-formed and regularly-constituted Lodges, are, or ought to be, so situated.<br><br>For which we assign three Masonic reasons:First reason:<br>The sun, the glory of the LORD, rises in the East and sets in the West.<br><br>Second reason:<br>Learning originated in the East, and from thence extended its benign influence to the West.<br><br>Third and last grand reason:<br>The last and grand reason refers to the situation of the Tabernacle in the wilderness. The nature of the Lodge—its form, dimensions, and supports—its ground, situation, and covering—its ornaments, furniture, and jewels—all unite their aid to form a perfect code of moral and theological philosophy; which, while it fascinates the understanding, improves the mind, until it becomes polished like the Perfect Ashlar, and can only be tried by the Square of GOD'S word and the unerring Compass of conscience.<br><br>Dr. OLIVER assigns the following reasons why the Tabernacle is considered as the type of a Freemason's Lodge:<br>"It was an oblong square, and, with its courts and appendages, it represented the whole habitable globe. Such is also the extent of our Lodges. The former was supported by pillars, and the latter is also sustained by those of Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty. They were equally situated due east and west. The sacred roll of GOD'S revealed will and law was deposited in the Ark of the Covenant; the same Holy Record is placed in a conspicuous part of our Lodges. The altar of incense was a double cube, and so is our pedestal and stone of foundation. The covering of the Tabernacle was composed of three colors, as a representation of the celestial hemisphere; such, also, is the covering of a Freemason's Lodge. The floor of the Tabernacle was so holy, that the priest's were forbidden to tread upon it without taking off their shoes; the floor of the Lodge is holy ground."<br><br>CALCOTT says that MOSES:<br>"foreseeing the difficulties which he would have to encounter before he should arrive in the promised land, and having already experienced the instability of the Israelites, caused the Tabernacle to be erected east and west, to excite in them a firm reliance on the omnipotence of that GOD who had then lately wrought so great a miracle in their favor, by causing a wind to blow first east, and then west, whereby they safely escaped from the Egyptians upon dry land, even through the midst of a sea, which, nevertheless, overwhelmed and totally destroyed their pursuers. And as they were liable to meet with many distresses in their sojournment in the wilderness, so, as oft as they should behold the situation of the Tabernacle, their faith might be strengthened, and, by a firm reliance on ALMIGHTY GOD, they might be enabled to proceed with resolution and cheerfulness. And as the Tabernacle was at that time to be a constant exhortation to them, from that great instance of omnipotence, to confide in GOD under all their embarrassments, so the Temple, afterwards built by SOLOMON, in the same form and situation, was to be a lasting monument to their posterity of the mighty works the LORD had performed in conducting their forefathers out of their captivity into the promised land. And this, also, may be deemed a very sufficient reason why places for Christian worship, after the pattern of the said Tabernacle and Temple, have ever been, and still are, generally erected in the same manner; for, as human creatures, we, as well as our forefathers, stand in need to be continually reminded of our weakness, and a necessary constant dependence on an Omnipotent and All-gracious Being."</td>

                <td class="text-content">Lodges are situated due East, and West, because King Solomon's Temple was so situated. King Solomon's Temple was so situated because Moses after safely conducting the children of Israel through the Red sea, when pursued by Pharoah and his hosts, had erected by divine command, a tabernacle dedicated to God, which was placed due East and West to perpetuate the remembrance of that mighty East wind by which their miraculous deliverance was wrought and to receive the rays of the rising sun. This tabernacle was an exact model for King Solomon's Temple, so all Lodges are or ought to be situated due East and West.</td>

King Solomon’s Temple is said to have been a representation of that Tabernacle.</td>
