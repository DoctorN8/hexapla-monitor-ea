The Mosaic pavement represents the ground floor of Solomon's temple; the indented tassel, that beautiful border which surrounded it; and the blazing star, in the centre, is in commemoration of the star by which the Magi, or wise men of the east, were conducted to the place of our Saviour's nativity. The Mosaic pavement is emblematical of human life, which is chequered with a strange variety of events, and our passage through this existence, though sometimes attended with prosperous circumstances, is often beset by a multitude of evils; hence the lodge is furnished with Mosaic work to remind us of the precariousness of our state on earth.<br><br>To day our feet tread in prosperity, to morrow we totter on the uneven paths of adversity. Whilst this emblem is before us, we are instructed to boast of nothing. To have compassion and give aid to those, who are in adversity; to walk uprightly and with humility; for pride was not made for man; hence though some, owing to adventitious circumstances, may, in this life, be placed in a more conspicuous situation than others, yet, when in the grave, whither we are all hastening, we shall be upon a level, as death destroys all distinction.<br><br>Whilst we tread on the Mosaic work, let our ideas return to the original, which it copies, and let the blazing star, the glory in the centre, remind us of that awful period when the Almighty delivered the two tables of stone containing the ten commandments to his servant Moses on mount Sinai, when the rays of his divine glory shone so bright, that none could behold it without fear and trembling. It also reminds us of the omnipresence of the Almighty, overshadowing us with his divine love and dispensing his blessings amongst us; and by its being placed in the centre, it ought also further to remind us, that wherever or however we may be assembled, God is in the midst of us, seeing our actions and observing the secret intents & movements of our hearts, while the indented tesselated border or skirt work alludes to that kind care of providence, which so constantly surrounds us and keeps within its protection, whilst we govern our lives and actions by the four cardinal virtues in divinity viz. Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, and Justice, which are situate as four tassels.</td>

                <td class="text-content">The ornaments of a Lodge are, the mosaic pavement, indented tessel, and the blazing star. The mosaic pavement is a representation of the ground-floor of King Solomon's temple; the indented tessel of that beautifully tesselated border or skirting which surrounded it; and the blazing star in the center is to remind us of the omnipresence of the Almighty, overshadowing us with his Divine love and dispensing his blessings amongst us. The mosaic pavement is emblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil; the beautiful border which surrounds it, of those manifold blessings and comforts that surround us, and which we hope to enjoy, by a faithful reliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by the blazing star in the center. As the steps of man are trod in the various and uncertain incidents of life; as our days are checkered with a strange contrariety of events, and our passage through this existence, though sometimes attended with prosperous circumstances, is often beset by a multitude of evils; hence is the Lodge furnished with mosaic work, to remind us of the precariousness of our state on earth; today, our feet tread in prosperity; to-morrow, we totter on the uneven paths of weakness, temptation and adversity. Whilst this emblem is before us, we are instructed to boast of nothing; to have compassion, and give aid to those who are in adversity; to walk uprightly, and with humility, for such is this existence, that there is no station in which pride can be stably founded—all men in birth and in the grave are on a level. Whilst we tread on this mosaic work, let our ideas return to the original which it copies; and let every Mason act as the dictates of reason prompt him, to live in brotherly love.</td>
