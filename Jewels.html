The second is used to lay levels and prove horizontals, so as to make two surfaces united as one solid. The third is used to try the corners of the building, and to bring rude matter into form, as well for ornament as for use.<br><br>Name the immovable jewels.<br>The rough ashlar, smooth ashlar, and tracing board.<br><br>Their uses?<br>The first is the representation of the brute stone, taken from the quarry, which is assigned to the entered apprentices, or brethren of the first degree, whose time is least valuable; that by their industry it may be brought into form, and made fit for use. The second is the smooth stone or polished ashlar, which has undergone the skill of the craftsman, and is used by him to adjust his tools and implements, as the criterion of truth and accuracy. The third is the implement on which the designs of Masters are formed, which therefore is restricted to the overseers, whose duty it is to arrange and distribute the plans of the building amongst the craftsmen; that the work may be properly executed, according to the rules of symmetry and proportion: thus in the case of these three jewels we find the brethren of all the three degrees usefully employed, in their separate departments.<br><br>Why are these implements called jewels?<br>On account of their moral tendency, which renders them jewels among Masons of inestimable value.<br><br>What moral is deduced from the movable jewels?<br>The plumb is the emblem of uprightness and integrity, the level of equality and union; the square of morality and harmony.<br><br>Why are they called movable jewels?<br>Because they are hung pendant to the breast of the three principal rulers of the Lodge, the Junior Warden, the Senior Warden, and the Master, as honourable badges of their stations.<br><br>What is the Junior Warden distinguished by?<br>By the plumb.<br><br>Why?<br>Because by that instrument, placed at his breast, he exemplifies his uprightness and integrity, in the faithful discharge of his duty as the guardian of the Lodge against the attempts of Intruders, who may dare to encroach on the privileges of the institution. To him therefore we owe the preservation of our rights, the sanctity of our oaths, and the permanency of our system.<br><br>What is the Senior Warden distinguished by?<br>By the level.<br><br>Why?<br>This instrument he bears on his breast as an emblem of the equality of his government in the West with the government of the Master in the East, as, without their joint aid, that union could not be effected in the Lodge which only contributes to its durability and strength.<br><br>What is the Master distinguished by?<br>By the square.<br><br>Why?<br>Because he bears this instrument on his breast as an emblem of the moral tenets it becomes his duty to inculcate, to promote that harmony and ensure that happiness among the brethren, which his judicious sway is intended to cherish and support.<br><br>What moral is deduced from the immovable jewels?<br>The rough ashlar is an emblem of the human mind in its pristine state, which, rude and uncultivated is like that stone before it has been improved by pious example and virtuous education. The smooth ashlar is a representation of the mind improved by culture and civilisation, enjoying all the advantages that can be derived from study, example, and education. The tracing board is the emblem of the book of nature, in which are delineated the designs of an all-supreme Being; an observance of these designs will lead to the perfection of our system, afford present, and ensure future happiness.<br><br>What further moral is deduced from these jewels united?<br>That, though nature bountifully supplies materials for our accommodation and use; it is the art and industry of man which can only render those materials truly valuable.<br><br>Why are they called immovable jewels?<br>Because they are perpetually fixed before us in the Lodge, as perpetual mementoes of their moral tendency.<br><br>Thus usefully employed, and honourably adorned, we practice the rites of our profession, undisturbed by the noisy clamour of party dissention; and uninterrupted by the tainted fumes of unbridled licentiousness.</td>

S.W. Why are you described by the Level?  <br>A: The Level, being an emblem of equality, points out the equal measures I am bound to pursue in conjunction with Your Worship and my brother Junior Warden in well ruling and governing the lodge.<br><br>Q: How is the Junior Warden described?  <br>A: By the Plumbrule.<br><br>Q: Br. J. W., why are you described by the Plumbrule?  <br>A: The Plumbrule being an emblem of uprightness, points out the upright conduct, I am bound to pursue in conjunction with Your Worship and my brother Senior Warden in well ruling and governing the lodge and more particularly in the examination of visitors lest by my misconduct any unquallified person might gain admittance and the brethren present innocently violate their obligation.<br><br>Q: Name the immoveable jewels!  <br>A: The Tracing-Board, and the Rough and Perfect Ashlers.<br><br>Q: Their uses?  <br>A: The Tracing-Board is for the Master to lay down his lines and draw his designs upon. The Rough Ashler is for the entered apprentice to carve, mark and indent upon, and the Perfect Ashler is for the more expert workman to try and adjust his jewels upon.<br><br>Q: There is a beautiful degree of comparison between the immoveable jewels and the furniture of the lodge namely the Bible, Compass and Square.  <br>A: As the Tracing-Board is for the Master to lay down his Lines, and draw his Designs upon, the better to enable the Craft, to carry on their Superstructure, with strict rules of Symmetry and Beauty; so may the Bible, Justly be Denominated the Tracing-Board of the grand Architect of the Universe in which are laid down such divine Laws, and moral Plans, that if we strictly adhere to them, it will bring us to a Mansion, not made by Hands, not subject to Decay, but the most permanent Structure, Eternal in the Heavens.  <br>The Rough Ashler, is a Stone, Rough and Unhewn, as taken from the Quarry, but by the Skill and Industry of the Workman, it is brought into due Form, and rendered fit for the intended Building; so is the mind of Man, in its infant and primitive State, rough and unpolished like unto that Stone; but by a liberal Education, and pious Example of his Parents or Guardians, his intellectual Powers are called forth, his Reason, Penetration, Perception, and his Judgement become Cultivated, and he is thereby rendered a fit Member, for a pollished and civilized Society.  <br>The Perfect Ashler, is a Stone of a true Die-Square, and is only to be tried and proved by the Square and Compass; so is Man, by a well spent Life, squared and pollished by the Laws of Religion and Morality, and only to be tried by the unerring Rule of God’s Word, and the Square and Compass, of his own approving good Conscience.<br><br>Q: Why are they called immoveable jewels?  <br>A: Because they are or ought to be always placed before us as mementos of what they morally represent.</td>

The Rough Ashlar is a stone rough as when taken from the Quarries, but by the skill and ingenuity of the workmen it is modelled and brought into due form, which represents the mind of man in its infancy, rough and uncultivated like this stone but by the kind care and instruction of his parents or guardians, in endowing his mind with a liberal education, he is thereby become moralized, and rendered a fit member for society. The Perfect Ashlar is of a true die square, which can only be tried by the Compasses and Square, which represents the mind of man, after a well spent life in acts of piety and devotion, which can no otherwise be tried but by the Square of God’s words, and the Compasses of his own conscience.<br><br>Q: Why are they called ImMovable?<br>A: Because they lay open in the lodge for every Brother to moralize on.</td>

It teaches us to walk with humility before God, and uprightness with mankind. It sets before us the danger of turning either to the right or left from the straight paths of virtue, for that is the duty of every man, more especially ours as Free and Accepted Masons. By it we are taught to be free from enthusiastic principles, and to steer clear of the abominable and degrading system of persecution. It tells us in the plainest language, that we are not to bend towards avarice, injustice, oppression, contempt or envy of our fellow creatures, but giving up every selfish propensity that might tend to injure others, and to steer the bark of this life over the rough seas of passion, without quitting the helm of rectitude, is one of the highest degrees of perfection, human nature is capable of attaining; for as the builder raises his column by the plane and perpendicular, so ought every Mason to carry himself uprightly, and to observe a due medium between intemperance and pleasure; to hold the scales of justice with an equal poise, so as to make all our passions and prejudices coincide with the just line of our conduct and in every pursuit to have eternity in view. Thus the Square teaches us morality and justice; the Level, a moderate, genuine and rational equality; and the Plumb Rule, a scientific and moral degree of uprightness through life.<br><br>Q: By whom are they worn in a Mason’s Lodge?<br>A: The Master, the Senior and Junior Wardens.<br><br>Q: What is the Master distinguished by?<br>A: By the Square.<br><br>Q: Why so?<br>A: As it is by the Square that all rude matter is brought into due form, so by the punctual adherence of the Master to his duty, are all animosities made to subside, should any arise in the Lodge, and the business of Masonry be properly conducted.<br><br>Q: What is the Senior Warden distinguished by and why?<br>A: By the Level, because it is an emblem of equality and points out the equal measures he is bound to pursue in conjunction with the Master and his brother Junior Warden in the well ruling and governing the Lodge.<br><br>Q: What is the Junior Warden distinguished by, and why?<br>A: By the Plumb Rule, because it is an emblem of uprightness, and points out the upright conduct that officer is bound to pursue in conjunction with the Master and his Brother Senior Warden in the well ruling and governing the Lodge; but more especially in the examination of visitors, lest through his neglect any unqualified person gains admittance, and the Brethren be innocently led to violate their obligation.<br><br>Q: Why are they called Moveable?<br>A: Because they hang pendent at the breast of the Master and Wardens, and are transferable to their successors on election nights.<br><br>Q: Name the Immoveable Jewels.<br>A: The Tracing Board, Rough Ashlar, and Cubical Stone.<br><br>Q: Their uses?<br>A: The Tracing Board is for the Master to lay down his lines, and draw his designs upon; the Rough Ashlar is for the Entered Apprentice to mark upon; and the Cubical Stone for the expert Fellow Crafts to try and adjust their Jewels.<br><br>Q: Please to explain the beautiful comparison of the Furniture and Immoveable Jewels?<br>A: As the Tracing Board is for the Master to draw his designs upon, the better to enable the younger Brethren, and the more expert Crafts, to carry on the intended building with order, regularity, and propriety; so may the Bible be justly deemed the true Tracing Board of the grand Architect of the universe; who in that holy book hath laid down such divine laws, and moral plans, that were we conversant therein, and adherent thereto, it would bring us to a building, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. The Rough Ashlar is a stone rough and unembellished as when taken from the quarry, but by the skill and ingenuity of the workmen it is modelled and brought into due form, and thereby rendered fit for the intended building, which represents the mind of man in its infancy, rough and uncultivated like this stone, but by the kind care and instruction of his parents or guardians, in endowing his mind with a liberal education, he is thereby become, moralized, and rendered a fit member for society. The Perfect Ashlar or Cubical Stone is of a true die Square, which can only be tried by the Compasses and Square, which represents the mind of man, after a well spent life in acts of piety and devotion, which cannot otherwise be tried but by the Square of God’s word, and the Compass of his own conscience.</td>
