The rude column first supported the temporary room, and gave rise to the idea of the Doric pillar, the emblem of strength. The human mind always prone to active industry soon led men to deduce this column into figure and shape. This happily produced in process of time the idea of the Ionic pillar the emblem of beauty. A spirit of emulation was now excited, each man vied to excel his fellow, and by the exertion of their united talents ornament to grace the column and gave birth to the idea of the finished base and enriched capital of the Corinthian pillar the emblem of wisdom.<br><br>What is the Grand Moral?<br>From this covering then we deduce the following moral: that when we fix our eyes on the celestial firmament and contemplate the beauties which are there displayed we behold wisdom to contrive, strength to support, and grace to adorn the handiwork of the Creator, in the construction of this canopy.<br><br>---</td>

He hath expanded the Heavens as a Canopy, the earth he hath planted as his footstool: he crowneth the heavens with stars as a diadem, and in his hand he extendeth the power and the glory. The Sun and Moon are messengers of his will and all his law is concord. The three Grand P[illars] which support our Lo[dge] are emblems of his power, they furthermore represent S[olomon,] K[ing of] I[srael,] H[iram,] K[ing of] T[yre] and H[iram] AB[iff,] the Widows Son of the tribe of Napthali. This universal harmony of nature, and natures works, emblematical of the peace and unity which subsists in a M[asonic] L[odge,] is produced from the union of those sublime qualities by which our fabric is supported, wisdom, strength and beauty.<br><br>Why those three great personages?<br>S[olomon,] K[ing of] I[srael,] for his great wisdom in building and dedicating the Temple of Jerusalem to Gods service; H[iram,] K[ing of] T[yre,] for his great strength in supporting him with men and materials, and H[iram] AB[iff,] the great and inspired Architect for his great ingenuity and curious workmanship in beautifying and adorning the same.<br><br>To what orders in Architecture do we refer them?<br>The three most celebrated amongst Masons, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian.<br><br>Please to inform me how W[isdom,] S[trength] & B[eauty] are depicted in our Lodges?<br>Wisdom is represented by the first grand pillar in the E[ast] and appropriated to the W[orshipful] M[aster] whose business is to exert his judgement and penetration in contriving the most proper and efficient means of completing the intended work, of what nature soever it may be. The Pillar of Beauty represents the J[unior] W[arden] in the S[outh] whose duty it is to adorn the work with all his powers of genius, and active industry; to promote regularity amongst the brethren by the sanction of his own good example, the persuasive eloquence of precept, and a discriminative encouragement of merit. The Pillar of Strength represents the S[enior] W[arden] in the W[est] whose duty it is to support the authority, and facilitate the designs of the master with all his influence among the Br[ethre]n and to see that his commands are carried into full and permanent effect. Thus by the united energies of these three presiding officers, the system is adorned and established, firm as a rock in the midst of the ocean, braving the malignant shafts of envy and detraction; its summit gilded with the rays of the meridian sun, though stormy winds and waves beat eternally on its basis.<br><br>---</td>

The universe is the temple of the DEITY whom we serve: Wisdom, Strength, and Beauty are about His throne as pillars of His work; for His wisdom is infinite, His strength is omnipotent, and His beauty shines forth through all His creation in symmetry and order.<br><br>As the work of building the temple at Jerusalem was conducted by the wisdom of SOLOMON, the strength of Hiram, king of Tyre, and the beauty, or cunning workmanship of HIRAM ABIFF, so the labors of the Lodge are supported by the wisdom, strength, and beauty of the three presiding-officers, who occupy the prominent stations in the East, West, and South; thus locally forming a triangle, which is a sacred emblem, and unitedly constituting one chief governor, by which the affairs of the Lodge are conducted, and without the presence of all three, or their legally-appointed representatives, no Lodge can be opened for the transaction of business, nor can any candidate be legally initiated therein.<br><br>---<br><br>* WISDOM is represented by the Ionic column and the W. M.; because the Ionic column wisely combines the strength without the massiveness of the Doric; with the grace, without the exuberance of ornament, of the Corinthian; and because it is the duty of the W. M. to superintend, instruct, and enlighten the Craft by his superior wisdom. SOLOMON, king of Israel, is also considered as the column of wisdom that supported the temple.<br><br>† STRENGTH is represented by the Doric column and the S. W.; because the Doric is the strongest and most massive of the Orders, and because it is the duty of the S. W., by an attentive superintendence of the Craft, to aid the W. M. in the performance of his duties, and to strengthen and support his authority. HIRAM, king of Tyre, is also considered as the representative of the column of strength which supported the temple.<br><br>‡ BEAUTY is represented by the Corinthian column and the J. W.; because the Corinthian is the most beautiful and highly finished of the Orders, and because the situation of the J. W. in the S. enables him the better to observe that bright luminary which, at its meridian height, is the beauty and glory of the day. — Thus, by the united energies of these three presiding-officers, the system is adorned and established firm as a rock in mid-ocean, braving the malignant shafts of envy and detraction; its summit gilded with the rays of the meridian sun, though stormy winds and waves beat furiously on its base.</td>
