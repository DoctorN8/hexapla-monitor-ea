If Death deprive him of his Friend or near Relation; if a Bed of Sickness be his Lot; if his House be rifled, or a Prison his Habitation, he remains calm and undisturb’d, nor do his Spirits rise and fall with his Condition; he relies on his Innocence and his God, and on that / Foundation stands fixed as a Rock</td>
