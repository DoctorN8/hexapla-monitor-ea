Grant that the sublime principles of Freemasonry, may so subdue every discordant passion within us—so harmonize and enrich our hearts with thine own love and goodness—that the Lodge at this time, may humbly reflect that order and beauty which reign forever before thy throne. Amen.<br><br>**1783 William Smith**<br>APPENDIX.<br>A PRAYER,<br>BY<br>William Smith, D. D. and Grand Secretary,<br>At the Opening the First GRAND COMMUNICATION,<br>December 20th, 1779, in the GRAND LODGE of Philadelphia, after some Years Interruption from the American War.<br>Published by Order of the GRAND LODGE.<br><br>FATHER of Light, - of Life and of Love! Supreme ARCHITECT and RULER of Heaven and Earth! Infinitely glorious God——Thou, at the Beginning, willing to communicate Happiness, and to establish Beauty, Order and Harmony, didst, from the Womb of thine own awful ETERNITY, give Birth to TIME; and, commanding the jarring Elements of Matter to cease their Strife, didst marshal them into an UNIVERSE compleat! Then, while the heavenly Hierarchies, with Voice and Harp, sung the loud Anthem of Joy, thou didst crown thy glorious Work, by breathing the Breath of Life into thine own IMAGE——MAN!<br><br>Be Thou with us at our present Beginning and to the End. In thy Name we assemble, and in thy Name we desire to proceed in all our Doings. Let the Wisdom of thy blessed Son, through the Grace and Goodness of the HOLY GHOST, so subdue every discordant Passion within us, so harmonize and enrich our Hearts with a Portion of thine own Love and Goodness, that the LODGE at this Time may be a sincere, though humble, Copy of that Order and Beauty and Unity, which reign for ever before thy heavenly Throne.<br><br>We thankfully acknowledge that Thou hast loved us, O Lord our God, with an exceeding great and eternal Love; and hast chosen us out of every People and Language. Our Fathers trusted in Thee, and were not ashamed——for Thou didst teach them the Statutes of Life, that they might do of thy good Pleasure with a perfect and willing Heart. As Thou didst sanctify the Days of old, and the Men thereof; even so sanctify Thou this Day to us, and us unto thy service. Remember not the Sins and Offences of our Forefathers; neither take Thou vengeance of our Sins: But spare us, good Lord; spare thy People whom thou hast redeemed with the precious Blood of thy most blessed Son. Let not thy Wrath wax hot against thine Inheritance——but give Peace in our Day, O Lord; because there is none other that fighteth for us, but only Thou, O God!<br><br>Bless and keep our country——that Country which our Fathers, under thy Guidance and Providence, did valiantly redeem from Bondage; and hand it down to us free and happy. Do Thou, who alone canst govern the unruly Wills and Affections of Sinful Men, give to thy chosen Servant, our President, and to all placed under him in Authority, Grace to execute Justice and maintain Truth. Let no iniquity be their Ruin; and no private Views or Passions prevail over the welfare of thy People!<br><br>Bless this our rising LODGE!—May Holiness to the Lord be engraven on all its Parts, and Love and Peace, Unity and Innocence, ever dwell therein. May every Brother who is now before Thee, and whatever may be his rank or degree, be a true and faithful Brother to the Craft, a lover of wisdom and virtue, and a doer of the word and not a hearer only, to his life's end! Amen.<br><br>As Thou didst unto them, so do Thou unto us; still remembering thy gracious Promise, “That where Two or Three are met together in thy Name, Thou wilt be in the midst of them.” [*]<br><br>By thus seeking and loving Thee, and by loving each other for thy Sake, shall thy Blessing and Peace be upon us from the four Corners of the Earth. Thou shalt put Understanding into our Hearts, and make us diligent to hear, to teach, and to do, all the Words of thy Law in Love—So shall we be built up a Spiritual Lodge, never to be shaken; but cleaving to thy great Name, and united to Thee in Love and Praise and Freedom of Soul for ever!<br><br>AMEN! SO MAY IT BE, FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST OUR SAVIOUR!<br></td>
