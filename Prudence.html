This is a virtue, which ought to be the peculiar characteristic of every mason; but, on this subject it cannot be necessary to enlarge.<br><br>Without suspicion of being betrayed in our words, or ensnared in the openness of our dealings, our mirth in the lodge is undisguised. It is governed by prudence, tempered with love, and clothed in charity. Thus it standeth void of offence. No malicious mind warps innocent expressions to wicked constructions, or interprets unmeaning jests into sarcasms or satires; but as every sentiment flows full of benevolence, so every ear in the lodge is attuned to the strain, in harmonious concord, and tastes the pleasures of festivity so pure, that they bear our reflections in the morning without remorse.<br><br>Peace, regularity, and decorum, are in the lodge, indispensable duties, nor are they the offspring of control or of authority, but a voluntary service, which every man brings to the lodge.<br><br>There are seasons, indeed, in which authority may be exercised with propriety. Man is frail, and the most prudent may sometimes deviate from the rules of strict propriety. It was a maxim of the ancient philosophers, that "to err was human, to forgive divine." In the lodge, therefore, there should be a constant governor, who should restrain those improprieties, which may creep in amongst us; but all this must be done with prudence.</td>
