                <td class="text-content">Some speculative Masons incorrectly believe that the Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem were the original founders of Masonry. This idea stems from the fact that these knights chose St. John as their patron, and all lodges are dedicated to St. John. From this, some infer that English and French lords involved in the Crusades were Freemasons. However, this notion overlooks the true motive for the institution of the Masonic order. Freemasons, having based their society on charity and equality, desired to align themselves with St. John to demonstrate their animating spirit, as St. John constantly preached union and brotherly love to his disciples with the words, "My dear children, love one another".<br>M. Why are our lodges dedicated to St. John?<br>W. Because the brother masons who united to conquer the Holy Land, chose that saint for their patron.‡</td>

                <td class="text-content">Q: To whom is the Lodge dedicated generally?<br>A: To the memory of Solomon, King of Israel; who was alike renowned for the depth of his wisdom, the extent of his power, and the superiority of his skill in the art.<br><br>Q: Why is it dedicated to King Solomon?<br>A: Because he was the first Grand Master who reduced the present system into form, and under whose sovereign protection the mysteries we retain first received a sanction: to this eminent character, therefore, the fraternity is bound to pay grateful tribute, and due veneration.<br><br>Q: To whom is it dedicated in particular?<br>A: In latter periods of the world other distinguished characters have attracted notice: hence John the Baptist stands forward as our leading patron; and to his memory we pay tribute.<br><br>Q: Why to John the Baptist?<br>A: In him we have a singular instance of purity of zeal, simplicity of manners, and an ardent wish to benefit mankind by his example. To him we are indebted for the introduction of that grand tenet of our institution, which it is our glory to support: Peace on earth, good will to man.<br><br>Q: Did John the Baptist have any equal?<br>A: To carry into execution this grant tenet; and to transmit to future ages so valuable a doctrine, an equal has been selected; John the Evangelist, in whom we find talents and learning alike conspicuous. Hence to him we pay due allegiance as the patron of our art.<br><br>Q: In what is he considered the equal of John the Baptist?<br>A: He is considered to be equal to the former in this. As the personal influence of John the Baptist could not extend beyond the bounds of a private circle or so effectually diffuse the benefits of the plan he had introduced, an assistant was necessary to complete the work he had begun. In John the Evangelist therefore we discover the same zeal as John the Baptist, and superior abilities displayed to perfect the improvement of man; copying the example of his predecessor we view him arranging and ably digesting, by his eminent talents, the great doctrine which had been issued into the world; and transmitting by his writings, for the benefit of posterity, the influence of that doctrine to which the zeal of his predecessor had given birth. As parallels in Masonry we rank these two patrons and class them as joint promoters of our system; to their memory in conjunction with Solomon, we are taught to pay due homage and veneration.<br><br>Thus we define the three great characters to whom we owe the establishment of our tenets, and the improvement of our system; while, in the ceremony of dedication, we commemorate the virtues and transmit them to latter ages, we derive from their favour, patronage and protection.</td>

But owing to the General confusion which took place under the reign of that Prince F[ree] M[asonry] fell much to decay, most Lodges were entirely broken up, and those who did meet were too few in number to constitute a legal Lodge, principally owing to the want of a Grand Master / (127) to patronize them: at length it was agreed upon by several Brothers who were convened for that purpose in the city of Benjamin, that a certain number should be deputed to wait on St. John the Evangelist (who was then Bishop of Ephesus) and solicit the favour of his patronizing the fraternity, by taking upon himself the acting part of G[rand] M[aster]. St. John the Evangelist returned for answer, he was then far advanced in years (being upwards of ninety) but having been in the early part of his life, initiated into the society, he would cheerfully comply with their request, and from that time down to the present day all Christian F[ree] M[ason’s] L[odges] have been dedicated to the Evangelist as well as the Baptist.<br><br>Q: What was the first chief reason that we dedicated our Lodges to St. John?<br>A: Because in the time of the Palestine wars, the Knights Masons,202 having joined themselves to those of St. John of Jerusalem, / (128) to fight against the infidels, put themselves under the protection of that great saint, and having gained the victory, they all agreed, after returning thanks, that the Lodges of Masons should be dedicated to him in future.<br><br>Q: What is the Principal point in M[asonr]y?<br>A: A p[oint] within a circle round which the M[aster] and Br[ethre]n cannot / (130) materially err.<br><br>Q: Please to explain it?<br>A: In all F[ree] M[asons’] well formed regular constituted Lodges, there is or ought to be a certain mathematical figure, round which the true professors of our science cannot materially err; this figure is supported on the dexter and sinister sides by two perpendicular lines approaching as near to parallels as the noble science of Geometry will authorise; which lines figure to our minds the two Masonic Saint Johns; upon the upper end part205 of this endless figure we view the Holy Bible containing the law and the Prophets, and supporting Jacobs ladder extended to Heaven, and were we as conversant in that holy book and as adherent thereto as those two grand parallels were[,] it would bring us to him who will not deceive us, neither will he suffer deception; and in going round this emblem we must unavoidably touch on both of those / (131) parallel lines as well as the H[oly] B[ible;] therefore while a M[ason] keeps himself thus circumscribed it is impossible he can materially err.</td>

Many LODGES were entirely broken up, and but few could meet in sufficient number to constitute legal Ones; and at a general meeting of the Craft, held in the City of Benjamin, it was observed, the principal Reason for the decline of Masonry, was the want of a Grand Master, to Patronize it; they therefore deputed Seven of their most eminent Members to St. John the Evangelist, who was at that time Bishop of Ephesus, requesting him, to take upon him, the Office of Grand Master. He gave for Answer, that tho’ well stricken in Years, (being upwards of Ninety,) yet having been in the early part of Life, initiated into Masonry, he would take upon himself that Office; he thereby completed by his Learning, what the other had begun by his Zeal, and drew a line Parallel; ever since which, Free Masons Lodge’s, have been dedicated, both to Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist.<br><br>Bs. please, to be charged!—Are you all charged?<br>All charged in the west, R.

B. S. W., what is the first point in masonry?<br>A: The left knee bare and bent. / (33)<br><br>Q: 172. Wherein is that the first point?<br>A: In a kneeling posture I was first taught to adore my creator and on my left knee bare and bent I was initiated into masonry.<br><br>Q: 173.

There is a principal point!<br>A: A point within a circle in going round which, it is said, the master and brethren cannot materially err.<br><br>Q: 175. Explain that point within a circle.<br>A: Why the MASTER and BRETHREN, cannot MATERIALLY ERR, in a FREE-MASON’S LODGE. In all regular Well-formed Free-mason’s LODGES, there is a Point within a Circle, in going round which, it is said, the MASTER and Brethren cannot materially Err: The Circle is bounded on the North and South, by Two Perpendicular Parallel Lines, that on the North, is said to represent Saint John the Baptist, and that on the South, Saint John the Evangelist. On the upper Points of those Lines, and on the Porphyry {= Periphery} of the Circle, rests the HOLY BIBLE, Supporting Jacob’s Ladder, which it is said, reaches to the watery Clouds of Heaven; it also contains the Dictates, of an Unerring OMNIPOTENT, and All-wise Being; so that whilst we are as conversant therein, and obedient thereto, as either of the Saint Johns were, it will bring us to HIM, that will neither Deceive, nor be Deceived by Us: Therefore, by keeping ourselves so Circumscribed, it is impossible, we can materially Err.</td>

                <td class="text-content">Lodges in ancient times were DEDICATED to King Solomon. We have a tradition which informs us, that they were thus dedicated from the building of the first Temple at Jerusalem to the Babylonish captivity ; from thence to the coming of the Messiah, they were dedicated to Zerubbabel, the builder of the second Temple ; and from that time to the final destruction of the Temple by Titus, in the reign of the Emperor Vespasian, they were dedicated to St. John the Baptist. The tradition goes on to say, that owing to the many massacres and disorders which attended that memorable event, Freemasonry fell very much into decay. Many of the Lodges were entirely broken up, and but few could meet in sufficient numbers to constitute their legality. Under these circumstances, a general meeting of the Craft was held in the city of Benjamin, when it was observed, that the principal reason for the decline of Masonry, was the want of a Grand Master to direct its affairs. They therefore deputed seven of their most eminent members to wait upon St. John the Evangelist, who was at that time Bishop of Ephesus, to request him to take the office of Grand Master. He returned for answer, that though well stricken in years (being upwards of ninety,) yet having been in the early part of his life initiated into Masonry, he would take upon himself that office. He did so, and thereby completed by his learning, what the other St. John had accomplished by his zeal, and thus drew what the old records term a line-parallel. After his decease the Christian Lodges were dedicated to him and St. John the Baptist, they both being regarded as eminent Christian patrons of Freemasonry. Since their time, there has been represented in every regular and well furnished Lodge, a certain POINT WITHIN A CIRCLE, embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist.

                <td class="text-content">Lodges in ancient times were dedicated to King Solomon * * *, and continued to be so dedicated until after the crusades. Among the various orders of knights engaged in those chivalric wars, none were more conspicuous than the magnanimous order of the Knights of St. John. Many brethren the ancient craft also went forth to aid in redeeming the sepulchre of the Saviour, from the hands of the infidel; between these and the knights of St. John, there existed a reciprocal feeling of brotherly love. On the plains of Jerusalem, they entered into a solemn compact of friendship, and it was mutually agreed between them that henceforth all lodges, whose members acknowledged the divinity of Christ, should be dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and St. John the Evangelist, who were two eminent Christian patrons of Freemasonry.<br><br>From that time, therefore, there has been represented, in every well governed Lodge, a certain POINT WITHIN A CIRCLE, embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing those two saints, upon the vertex of the circle rests the Holy Scriptures. The point within the circle represents an individual brother; the circle is the boundary line, beyond which he is never to suffer his passions to betray him. In going round this circle, he must necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as the Holy Scriptures; which teaches us that while a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within their precepts, it is impossible that he should materially err.</td>

This circle is embordered by two perpendicular parallel lines, representing those Saints, who were perfect parallels in Christianity, as well as in Masonry; and upon the vertex rests the Holy Scriptures, which point out the whole duty of man. In going around this circle, we necessarily touch upon these two lines, as well as upon the Holy Scriptures; and while a Mason keeps himself thus circumscribed, it is impossible that he should materially err.<br><br>"But though past all diffused, without a shore His essence; local is his Throne, as meet To gather the dispersed, as Standards call The listed from afar; to fix a point, A central point, collective of his sons. Since finite every nature but his own. If earth's whole orb by some dire distant eye Were seen at once, her towering Alps would sink. And level'd Atlas leave an even sphere. Thus earth, and all that earthly minds admire. Is swallow'd In Eternity's vast round," — [EDWARD YOUNG The Complaint, and the Consolation; or, Night Thoughts]<br><br>"Whether we regard this symbol in the purity of its legitimate interpretation, or consider the unlimited corruption which it sustained in its progress through the mysteries of idolatry, the general principle will be found equally significant. It was originally the conservator of a genuine moral precept, founded on a fundamental religious truth; but innovation followed innovation, until this degraded symbol became the dreadful depository of obscenity and lust.<br><br>"The use of this emblem is coeval with the first created man. A primary idea which would suggest itself to the mind of ADAM, when engaged in reflections on his own situation, the form of the universe, and the nature of all the objects presented to his view, would be, that the creation was a circle and himself the center. This figure, implanted without an effort, would be ever present in all his contemplations, and would influence his judgment to a certain extent, while attempting to decide on the mysterious phenomena which were continually before him. To persons unacquainted with the intricate philosophy of Nature, as we may fairly presume ADAM was, this is the plain idea conveyed to the senses by a superficial view of Nature's works. Ask an unlettered hind of the present day, and he will tell you that the earth is a circular plane; and perhaps he will have some indistinct notion that the expanse above his head is spherical, but he will assuredly look upon himself as the common center of all. This is consistent with the general appearance of things; for, if he look around, be finds the horizon, unless intercepted by the intervention of sensible objects, equally distant from the point of vision in all its parts. And the experiment uniformly producing the same results, whether made by night or day, he relies on the evidence of his senses, and pronounces his own judgment correct and irrefutable. So the first created man. Himself the center of the system, he would regard Paradise as the limit of the habitable earth, and the expanse as the eternal residence of the omnipresent Deity. A little reflection, however, would soon bring him nearer to the truth. The garden of Eden was of a circular form, and the Tree of Life was placed in the center. Now, as the fruit of this tree was reputed to convey the privilege of immortality, the center would hence be esteemed the most honorable situation, and be ultimately assigned to the Deity, who alone enjoys the attributes of immortality and eternity; for ADAM, in his progress to different parts of this happy abode, would soon conclude that, however he might be deceived by appearances, he himself could not be a permanent center, because he was constantly changing his position.<br><br>"To this august Circle the two forbidden trees were the accompanying perpendicular parallel lines, pointing out GOD'S equal justice and mercy. When ADAM had violated the divine command, and eaten of the tree of knowledge, justice demanded that the threatened penalty should be paid. But here mercy interposed, and he was expelled from the abode of purity and peace, now violated by transgression, 'lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and live for ever' in a state of wickedness and sin. Hence arose the Masonic emblem of a Point within a Circle."<br><br>"When mankind had transferred their adoration from the Creator to his works, they advanced specious reasons to justify a devotion to spheres and circles. Every thing great and sublime, which was continually presented to their inspection, partook of this form. The sun, the unequivocal source of light and heat, was a primary object of attention, and became their chief deity. The earth, the planets, and fixed stars, proceeding in all their majestic regularity, excited admiration, and implanted devout feelings in their hearts. These were all spherical, as was also the arch of heaven, illuminated with their unfading luster. The next progressive observations of mankind would be extended to the unassisted efforts of Nature in the production of plants and trees; and these were found to exhibit, for the most part, the same uniform appearances. From the simple stalk of corn, to the bole of the gigantic lord of the forest, the cylinder and cone, and consequently the circle, were the most common forms assumed by the vegetable creation. Every fruit he plucked — every root he dug from the earth for food — was either globular, cylindrical, or conical, each partaking of the nature of a circle. If a tree were divided horizontally, the section uniformly exhibited the appearance of a Point within a succession of concentric circles. The same will be true of many varieties of vegetables; and similar results would be produced from an inspection of animal bodies. The trunk is a cylinder; and the intestines, so often critically examined for the purposes of augury, presented to the curious inquirer little variation from the general principle. Hence statues bearing these forms were subsequently dedicated to the Olympic gods; a Cylinder, to the earth; and a Cone to the sun.<br><br>"In this figure, Nature, in her most sportive mood, appeared exclusively to delight. If a bubble were excited on the water, it was spherical; and if any solid body were cast upon, the surface, the ripple formed itself into innumerable concentric circles, rapidly succeeding each other, of which the body, or moving cause, was the common center. If water were cast into the air, they found that the drops invariably arranged themselves into a globular form. This uniformity was soon observed, and thought to be a preternatural indication of divinity; for if Nature assumed one unvarying character in all her works, that character must be an unquestionable symbol of the GOD of Nature. Hence the Circle, with its center distinctly marked, became a most sacred emblem with every nation of idolaters; adopted perhaps from the same symbol used by their<br><br>forefathers on the plain of Shinar; referring primarily to the immeasurable expanse occupied by infinite space; a proper type of eternity, but now justified by a reference to the works of Nature. This was the general belief, though the expression varied in different ages and among the inhabitants of different nations.<br><br>"The tribes contiguous to Judea placed a Jod (’) in the center of a circle, as a symbol of the Deity surrounded by Eternity, of which He was said to be the inscrutable author, the ornament, and the support. The Samothracians had a great veneration for the Circle, which they considered as consecrated by the universal presence of the Deity; and hence rings were distributed to the initiated, as amulets possessed of the power of averting danger. The Chinese used a symbol which bore a great resemblance to that which is the subject of this annotation. The Circle was bounded north and south by two serpents, (equivalent to the two perpendicular parallel lines of the Masonic symbol,) and was emblematical of the Universe, protected and supported equally by the Power and Wisdom of the Creator. The Hindoos believed that the Supreme Being was correctly represented by a perfect sphere, without beginning and without end. The first settlers in Egypt transmitted to their posterity an exact copy of our Point within a Circle, expressed in emblematical language. The widely-extended universe was represented as a circle of boundless light, in the center of which the Deity was said to dwell; or, in other words, the circle was symbolical of His eternity; and the perpendicular parallel lines by which it is bounded, were the two great luminaries of heaven, the sun and moon; the former denoting His virtue — the latter His wisdom. And this idea was generally expressed by a hawk's head in the center of a circle, or an endless serpent inclosing an eye.<br><br>"But the most expressive symbol to this effect used by any people who had renounced the true religion, was the famous emblem of PYTHAGORAS, who contrived not merely to express the only one GOD, residing in the midst of eternity, but united with it an idea of the divine Triad, and blended emblems of regeneration, morality, and science. For this purpose he added to the central Jod nine other Jods, disposed about the center in the form of an equilateral triangle, each side consisting of the number FOUR. The disciples of PYTHAGORAS denominated this symbol Trigonon-mysticum, because it was the conservator of many awful and important truths.<br><br>"1. The Monad, or active principle.<br><br>"2. The Duad, or passive principle.<br><br>"3. The Triad, or world proceeding from their union.<br><br>"4. The sacred Quaternary, involving the liberal Sciences, Physics, Morality, etc., etc.<br><br>"Of this remarkable emblem, a full explanation may be equally interesting and instructive.<br><br>"The symbol of all things, according to PYTHAGORAS, was one and two. One added to two make three; and once the square of two make FOUR, which is the perfect Tetractys; and 1+2+3+4=10, the consummation of all things; and therefore the amount of the points contained within the Pythagorean Circle is exactly TEN. Hence, because the first four digits added into each other made up the number ten, this philosopher called the number four 7iavxa apiGpov, all number, or the whole number; and used it as the symbol of universality. * To ascertain, however, the entire meaning of this symbol, it will be necessary to take the numbers included within the Circle in their natural order, and hear what hidden mystery the philosophy of PYTHAGORAS attached to each.<br><br>"The number ONE was the Point within the Circle, and denoted the central fire, or GOD; because it is the beginning and ending — the first and the last. It signified, also, love, concord, piety, and friendship; because it is so connected that it cannot be divided into parts. Two meant darkness, fortitude, harmony, and justice; because of its equal parts; and the moon, because she is forked. THREE referred to harmony, friendship, peace, concord, and temperance. All these, and many other virtues, depended on this number and proceeded from it. FOUR referred to the Deity: for it was considered the number of numbers. It is the first solid figure; a point being 1, a line 2, a superficies 3, and a solid 4. It was also the Tetractys; a WORD sacred among the Pythagoreans, and used as a most solemn oath; because they considered it the root and principle, the cause and maker, of all things."<br><br>"The Point within the Circle afterwards became a universal emblem to denote the temple of the Deity, and was referred to the Planetary Circle, in the center of which was fixed the sun, as the universal god and father of nature; for the whole circle of heaven was called GOD."<br><br>"SERVIUS tells us it was believed that the center of a temple was the peculiar residence of the Deity; the exterior decorations being merely ornamental. Hence the astronomical character used to denote or represent the sun, is a Point within a Circle; because that figure is the symbol of perfection. The most perfect metal, gold, is also designated in chemistry by the same character.<br><br>"With this reference the Point within a Circle was an emblem of great importance among the British Druids. Their temples were circular, many of them with a single stone erected in the center; their solemn processions were all arranged in the same form; their weapons of war — the circular shield with a central boss, the spear with a hollow globe at its end, etc. — all partaking of this general principle; and without a circle it was thought impossible to obtain the favor of the gods."<br><br>Footnotes<br><br>* The sum of all the principles of PYTHAGORAS is this: — "The Monad is the principle of all things. From the Monad came the Indeterminate Duad, as matter subjected to the cause of Monad; from the Monad and the indeterminate Duad, numbers; from numbers, points; from points, lines; from lines, superficies; from superficies, solids; from these solid bodies, whose elements are four — Fire, Water, Air, and Earth — of all which transmuted, and totally changed, the WORLD consists.”</td>
