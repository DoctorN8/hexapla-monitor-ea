The North East corner of the Lodge, or the right of the Master.<br><br>Mas. Why there?<br>Ans. That he may tread sure and obey the commands of the Master.<br><br>Mas. Why does he tread surer there than in any other part?<br>Ans. Because there he treads on the foundation stone of the building.<br><br>Mas. To what does this allude?<br>Ans. To an established custom of laying the foundation stone of all capital buildings at the North East corner.<br><br>Mas. What advantages are derived from this custom?<br>Ans. When the ravages of time or violence may have destroyed every vestige of the superstructure, that stone, when it is discovered will prove that such a building did exist; announces the names of its founders, and the purposes for which it has been erected.<br><br>Mas. How do we apply this in Masonry?<br>Ans. That, when amidst the depravity of manners the influence of example may tend to subvert the principles of virtue, the original rules of the institution, then impressed in the mind of the Mason on the foundation stone might never be obliterated from his memory; but these seeds of virtue, which had been sown there, might ward off the danger of infection, prevent the operation of poison, and preserve the mind uncontaminated, amidst the general wreck of polished manners.<br><br>Mas. In what form does he appear?<br>Ans. With his feet formed into a square, the body erect, and the eye fixed on the Master.<br><br>Mas. What information is then given to him?<br>Ans. That he then stands to all appearances before God and the Lodge a just and upright man and Mason.<br><br>Mas. What recommendation does he then receive?<br>Ans. That when from that spot he departs, that character through life he may support and maintain.</td>

At the northeast corner of the lodge, with my feet formed in a square and my body erect, when the right worshipful master was pleased to inform me, that I then stood to all external appearance as a just and upright man and mason and gave it me in the strongest recommendation always to continue and act as such.<br><br>Q. Why was you placed at the northeast corner of the lodge?<br>A. It being the usual custom in all magnificent and superb structures to place the first stone at the northeast corner of the building, if found convenient, I was placed at the northeast corner of the lodge to represent that stone and to shew, that I stood in the first degree, that of an entered apprentice.</td>

That being the place where Operative Brethren lay the first stone of every magnificent structure, I was therefore placed there as a fit representative of that stone, being then in the first, and most superficial part thereof.<br><br>Q. What did you there receive?<br>A. The first and most impressive part was the constant perusal of the Holy Bible, and the three grand duties of morality; to God, as never mentioning His Name, but with that awe and reverence due from a creature to his Creator; to esteem Him our chief good, and to implore His aid in all our undertakings. To our Neighbour, as acting with him upon the square in all our different connections. To our-selves, by avoiding every degree of intemperance, unbecoming the dignity of the human species.</td>

The squareness of its surface, emblematic of morality — its cubical form, emblematic of firmness and stability of character — and the peculiar finish and fineness of the material, emblematic of virtue and holiness — show that the ceremony of the north east corner of the Lodge was undoubtedly intended to portray, in the consecrated language of symbolism, the necessity of integrity and stability of conduct, of truthfulness and uprightness of character, and of purity and holiness of life, which just at that time and in that place the candidate is most impressively charged to maintain. </td>
