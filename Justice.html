But as Time will not permit me to expatiate on each particular Branch, I shall be as brief as possible. But what have I undertaken? Love presents itself, and claims my Attention. How can I attempt to desire that which the Greatest Men have in vain endeavour’d to describe? This however shall not discourage me. Tho’ Language is too weak, and Words fall short, so that we cannot paint this heavenly Virtue in its true Colours, since it can only be known to those whose Hearts are susceptible of so divine an Impression; yet the principal Advantages arising from it to Society demand our Consideration at this Time. Love / founded on Truth is the Basis of all Society; it is this that makes the happy Pair,<br>– and in one Fate<br>* Their Hearts, their Fortunes, and their Beings blend.</td>
