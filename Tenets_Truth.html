There is a charm in truth that draws and attracts the mind continually towards it; the more we discover, the more we desire, and the great reward is, wisdom, virtue, and happiness. This is an edifice founded upon a rock, which malice cannot shake, or time destroy. What a secret satisfaction do we enjoy, when in searching for truth, we find the first principles of useful science, still preserved among us, as we received them, by oral tradition from the earliest ages; and we also find this truth corroborated by the testimonies of the best and greatest men the world has produced. But this is not all; the sacred writings confirm what I assert; the sublime part of our ancient mystery being there to be found; nor can any Christian / brother be a good mason that does not make the word of God his first and principal study.</td>

This, therefore is a theme, which we ought to contemplate, and, by its dictates, endeavour to regulate our conduct; for we are told, that God "desireth truth in the inward parts." Psalm li. 6.<br><br>The arts of deceit and cunning continually grow weaker and less effectual to those who practice them, while, on the other hand, integrity gains strength by use, and the more and the longer any man accustoms himself to it, the greater service it will do him; as it will establish his reputation, and thus encourage others to repose in him the greatest trust and confidence, which may be certainly considered as being of unspeakable advantage in the common affairs of life.<br><br>Truth is, always consistent with itself, and needs nothing to help it out. It is near at hand; it sits upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware; but a lie is troublesome, and sets a man's invention constantly on the rack to preserve even a tolerable appearance of consistency. A lie is like a building upon a false foundation, which continually stands in need of props to preserve it, and proves, at last, more chargeable than the erection of a substantial building would have been upon a true and solid foundation. Truth is firm; It is irresistible, and those who practise it, in all their transactions, can never be put to shame. "The wicked flee, when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion." Let us, therefore, not only in regard to truth, but, likewise, every other moral duty, always maintain the testimony of a good conscience, and we have nought to fear.<br><br>Influenced by these principles, in our intercourse with each other, and with the world at large, hypocrisy and deceit should be unknown among us; and the heart and tongue should unite in promoting our mutual welfare, and in rejoicing in each other's prosperity.<br><br>Truth has ever been a distinguishing prerequisite among free-masons; and, he who deviates from it, in a single instance, is acting in direct opposition to one of the first precepts of the order.<br><br>"The man, whose mind on virtue beat,<br>Pursues some greatly good intent,<br>With undiverted aim,<br>Serene, beholds the angry crowd,<br>Nor can their clamour, fierce and loud,<br>His stubborn honour tame."<br>—Blacklock</td>
