But as most of these are partial, contracted or confined to a particular country, religion, or opinion; our order, on the contrary, is calculated to unite mankind as one family: High and low, rich and poor, one with another; to adore the same God, and observe his law.6 All worthy members of this society are free to visit every lodge in the world; and though he knows not the language of the country, yet by a silent universal language of our own, he will gain admittance, and find that true friendship, which flows from the brotherly-love I am now describing.</td>

Relief is the next tenet of our profession; to relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but more particularly among Masons, who are linked together in one indissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to sympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries, and to restore peace to their troubled minds, is the grand aim we have in view; on this basis we establish our friendship, and form our connection. Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue; to be good and true is the first lesson we are taught at our initiation: hence hypocrisy and deceit are supposed to be unknown among us; sincerity and plain dealing are our distinguishing characteristics, while the heart and tongue join in promoting each other’s welfare, and rejoicing in each other’s prosperity.<br><br>---</td>

On this principle, Masonry unites men of every country, sect, and opinion, and conciliates true friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a perpetual distance.<br><br>Brotherly Love or Friendship is regarded by Freemasons as the strong cement of the Order; without this high moral virtue, the Fraternity would soon cease to exist. By Brotherly Love, we are to understand that generous principle of the soul which regards the human species as one family, created by an All-wise Being, and placed on this globe for the mutual assistance of each other. The man who is actuated by the pure principle of Brotherly Love, will not desert his friend when dangers threaten or misfortunes assail him. When he is calumniated, he will openly and boldly espouse his cause, and endeavor to remove the aspersion. When sickness or infirmity occasion him to be deserted by others, he will seize the opportunity, and redouble all the affectionate attentions which love suggests. No society can exist for any length of time, unless Brotherly Love prevail among its members. To "dwell together in unity," is the life and support of the great Masonic institution.</td>
