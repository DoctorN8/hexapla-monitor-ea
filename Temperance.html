It does not deny us the Use of any of those Blessings that the Almighty has in his great Goodness bestowed on us: No; it only teaches us not to enjoy them to Excess, and to do nothing that will prejudice our Reason, our Healths, our Families, or our Fortunes. Prudence is the Parent of Temperance. It is Prudence that will direct us to the Choice of our Company before our Liquor, and to shun all Occasions that may lead to Excess. It is too true, that evil Communication corrupts good Manners: And however singular we may appear to be in the Opinion of unthinking Men, yet it must be a secret Satisfaction to every Mason, when he considers that exact Decorum and Regularity with which our Meetings are always attended; where the strictest Temperance is observ’d; where nothing profane, immoral, or ludicrous, is permitted; nor any thing offer’d to disturb the Harmony of our Society. Let us then, my Brethren, continue to persevere in this and every other Virtue.</td>

                <td class="text-content">Temperance may be defined to be the restraint of passion. That it is a quality essential to happiness, reason and observation bear ample testimony. So highly, indeed, has it always been esteemed, that it ranks as a virtue in every system of morality; for as uncontrouled passions lead us to wickedness and turbulence, so temperance leads us to virtue and tranquillity. Even in worldly affairs it is found to be a guide to health, wealth, and prosperity; for it forbids us to indulge in enervating luxuries, and inculcates economy in all the concerns of life.<br><br>Its best recommendation is to be found in its effects; and no one, who is convinced, that temperance leads to bliss, can hesitate in adhering to it through life. It is essentially necessary that this virtue should be observed by all, who wish to live with comfort; but, for reasons, which will naturally occur to every free-mason, it is peculiarly proper, that it should be observed by them.<br><br>The dire effects of intemperance are thus most pathetically described by an ingenious poet; if I remember right, the late Rt. Rev. Dr. Porteous, bishop of London.<br>"The drunkard’s sin, excess, abhor,<br>He drowns his health, his wealth, his fame;<br>He ruins wife, and children dear,<br>And sinks them all in want and shame.<br><br>He wastes the hours, designed for toil,<br>And sinks in sloth and dull repose;<br>He spurns the hand, that fain would save,<br>And deeper in destruction goes.<br><br>He scorns religion’s gentle voice,<br>And madly breaks her golden rule;<br>He hates the friendly, wise advice,<br>And turns his back on wisdom’s school.<br><br>He courts disease, he courts distress,<br>He courts the world’s contempt and hate;<br>And, when he dies, he dies unblest,<br>And leaves a dark, polluted fate."</td>
