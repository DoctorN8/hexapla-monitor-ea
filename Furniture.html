                <td class="text-content">Q: What is that furniture?<br>A: It consists of the sacred law, the square, and the compasses.<br><br>Q: The use of that furniture?<br>A: The sacred law is used as the guide of our faith; and inculcates our duty to God. On that law we pledge our fidelity in every degree of the order. The square and compasses are united on that law to mark the class to which we belong, and to inculcate the duty we owe to our neighbour and to ourselves. By the proper use of this furniture we are instructed to manifest to the world our merit as Masons.<br><br>Q: How is that furniture appropriated?<br>A: To the separate classes of the order. To the brethren of every degree the sacred law is laid open; to the craftsmen, or fellows, of the order the virtues of the square are displayed; to the overseers or Master Masons the accuracy and merits of the compasses are made known; and from this latter part of the furniture we trace the badge of honour, which marks the Grand Patron of the art.<br><br>Q: Why is the sacred law appropriated to the fraternity in general?<br>A: Because in that law our great Creator has made known more of his divine will to man, than has otherwise been done by the light of nature, with all her beauties displayed to the discerning eye; or by the strength of reason, with all its powers, exerted to cultivate and improve the mind. From no class therefore can this part of the furniture be excluded.<br><br>Q: Why is the square assigned to the craftsmen?<br>A: Because the craftsmen, obligated within the square, bound to act upon it, always tried by it; must know its merit, and be best able to estimate its value.<br><br>Q: Why are the compasses restricted to the Grand Master?<br>A: The compasses are appropriated to Master Masons; because it is the chief instrument used in the delineation of their plans; and from this class all genuine designs originate: by these designs the accuracy of the work is traced, and the value of labour ascertained. As an emblem of dignity and excellence, the compasses are pendant to the breast of the Grand Master; to mark the superiority of character he bears among Masons.<br><br>Q: What is the Grand Moral?<br>A: From this clause therefore we derive one grand moral; that when furniture so valuable is provided for our accommodation, it becomes our duty to preserve it, in its original purity, hence we enjoy in our happy retreat all the comforts it affords; and are encouraged to exert our united talents to effect the completion of our designs, and add to the perfection of our system.</td>
