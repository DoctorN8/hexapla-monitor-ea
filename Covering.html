Jacob was no sooner in possession of his aged fathers blessing than he was obliged to flee from the wrath of his brother who had purposed in his heart to slay him, not only for supplanting him in his aged fathers blessing, but in his birthright also. Rebecca was no sooner informed of Esau’s intention / (107) than she prevailed upon Jacob to go down to Padan Aram, a distant country in the land of Mesopatamia [sic] and there marry one of the Daughters of Laban, Rebecca’s Brother, but as Jacob journeyed thither a remarkable circumstance attended his first days travel, being weary and benighted he laid him down to rest, taking the cold earth for his bed, a stone for his pillow, and the clouded canopy of Heaven for his covering: it was there, in a vision, he saw a ladder resting on the earth, its top extended to the Heavens, with the angels of God ascending and descending thereon; those ascending were representations of those going up to the throne of grace to receive divine commissions to bring down and propagate on the face of the earth for the use and benefit of mankind; those descending, were representatives of those commissioned with that power: it was there that the Lord was pleased to make / (108) a solemn league or Covenant with Jacob that if he would walk in his ways and keep his statutes, he would not only bring him back in peace and plenty to his fathers house, but he would exalt his posterity in a wonderful manner; we therefore not only find, that Jacobs favourite son was by Pharoahs appointment raised to the highest degree of exaltation, but the Children of Israel, in process of time, became the greatest and mightiest nation in that part of the world.<br><br>Q: How many S[teps] or R[ails]190 is this ladder composed of?<br>A: As many as will point out every moral and social virtue, but the three principle of which are Faith, Hope, and Charity.<br><br>Q: Why these three?<br>A: Faith in Christ, Hope in salvation, and Charity with all Mankind.<br><br>Q: Please to explain them?<br>A: Faith is the foundation of justice, the bond of amity, and the chief support of / (109) society, we live and walk by faith, by it we have an acknowledgement of a supreme being, have access to the throne of Grace, are justified, accepted and finally received, a true Christian faith is the evidence of things not seen but 236 British Freemasonry, 1717–1813: Volume 3 the substance of things hoped for, this maintained and well answered by walking according to our Masonic profession will turn faith into a vision, and bring us to that blessed mansion above, where the just exist in perfect bliss to all eternity, and where we shall be eternally happy with God the grand Architect of the Universe; whose son died for us and rose again that we might be justified thro’ faith in his most precious blood.191 Hope is an anchor of the soul192 both sure and steadfast, then let a firm reliance in the Almighty’s goodness animate all our endeavours and enable us to fix our hopes within the limits of his / (110) most precious promises, so shall success attend us; if we believe a thing impossible our despondency may render it so, but if we persevere to the end in a just cause, we shall finally overcome all difficulty. Charity, Oh! how lovely is the theme; it is the brightest and greatest ornament of our masonic profession; benevolence rendered by Heaven-born Charity is an honor to the nation from whence it springs, is nourished, and cherished; happy is the man who hath sown in his breast the seeds of benevolence, the produce of which is love and Charity, he envieth not his neighbour, he believeth not a tale when reported by a slanderer, he forgiveth the injuries of men and blotteth them out from his recollection,193 then let us ever remember that we are [= as] Masons, and men, ever be ready to give (if able) / (111) to the needy, and in the time of the most pressing necessity let us not withhold a liberal hand, so shall the heartfelt pleasure reward our labour, and the produce of Love and Charity most assuredly follow.<br><br>Q: On what does this Ladder rest?<br>A: On the Holy Bible.<br><br>Q: Why so?<br>A: By the doctrines therein contained we are taught to believe in the dispensations of divine providence which belief strengthens our faith, and enables [us] to ascend the first step; this faith naturally creates in us a hope of becoming partakers of the blessed promises therein recorded, which hope enables us to ascend the second step.

How do we hope to arrive at it?<br>A: By the help of a ladder.<br><br>Q: 129. In Scripture what called?<br>A: Jacob’s Ladder.<br><br>Q: 129a. Why called Jacob’s ladder?<br>A: EXPLANATION of JACOB’s LADDER. Gen. Ch. 27, 28, 41. REBECKAH, the beloved Wife of Isaac, well knowing there was a peculiar Blessing vested in the Soul of her Husband, was resolved to obtain it for her youngest Son Jacob, although by Birth-right, it belonged to Esau her First-born. They no sooner by Fraud had obtained this Blessing, but Jacob was obliged to flee from the Wrath of his Brother, who proposed in his Mind to slay Him. And as he Journeyed to PADANARAM, in the Land of MESOPOTAMIA, where by his Parents strict Commands, he was enjoined to go, he came to a desert Plain; and the Sun being gone down, he was obliged to take up his abode there for the Night, where he had the cold Ground for his Bed, a Stone for his Pillow, and the Celestial-Canopy for his Covering; as he Slumbered, in a Vision, he saw a Ladder, the Bottom of which rested upon the Earth, and the Top reached to Heaven, whereon the Angels of GOD were Ascending and Descending; those Angels Ascending, were going to receive the Divine Commands, and those Descending, were comming to put those Laws into Execution. / (24) It was then and there, the ALMIGHTY entered into a solemn Covenant with Jacob; that if he would abide by his Laws, and fulfil his Commands, he would not only bring him back to his Father’s House in Peace and Plenty, but would make of him a great and mighty People; and as in process of Time, Joseph, the Son of Jacob, by Pharaoh’s Appointment, became second Man in Command in Egypt, and the Israelites became the Great and Mightiest Nation, under the Heavens.<br><br>Q: 130. How many rounds or staves is that ladder composed of?<br>A: Many rounds or staves which point out as many moral virtues, but three principal ones, namely Faith, Hope and Charity.<br><br>Q: 131. Describe Faith, Hope and Charity!<br>A: Faith in Christ, Hope in salvation, and to live in Charity with all mankind.<br><br>Q: 132. There is a further explanation of Faith, Hope and Charity which are to be explained separately round.<br>A: EULOGIUM, on FAITH, HOPE, and CHARITY. FAITH is the foundation of Justice, the bond of Amity, and chief support of Society, we live by FAITH, we walk by FAITH, by FAITH, we have a continual Hope in the acknowledgement of a Supreme Being; by FAITH, we are Justified, Accepted, and finally Received. A true Christian FAITH, is the Substance of Things hoped for, the Evidence of Things not seen,7 this well maintained in answering our MASONIC Profession, will turn FAITH into a Vision, and bring us to those blessed Mansions, where we shall be eternally Happy with GOD, the Grand Architect of the Universe, whose SON died for Us, and rose again, that we might be Justified through FAITH, in his most precious Blood. HOPE is the Anchor of the Soul, both Sure and Stedfast, and entereth into8 that within the Veil;9 let a firm Reliance in the Almighty’s Faithfulness, animate our Endeavors, and teach us to fix our Hopes, within the limits of his blessed Promises, so shall Success attend us; if we believe a Thing to be Impossible, our Despondency may render it so; but he that persevereth will overcome all Difficulties. / (25) CHARITY! O how lovely is thy Theme! it is the brightest Gem that can adorn our Masonic Profession; It is the best Test and the best Proof of Religion; Benevolence, attended by Heaven-born CHARITY, is an Honor to a Nation from whence it springs, is Nourished and Cherished; happy is the MASON, who has sowed in his Breast the Seeds of Benevolence, the produce thereof is Love and CHARITY: He envieth not his Neighbour, he listeneth not to a Tale, when reported to his Slander; Revenge or Malice, hath no place in his Breast: He forgiveth the Injuries of Men, and endeavoureth to blot them from his Recollection: Let us therefore remember that we are Christians and MASONS, ever ready to listen to him who craveth our Assistance, and from him who is in want, not to withhold a liberal Hand; so shall an heartfelt Satisfaction reward our Labour, and the produce of Love and and CHARITY most assuredly follow.<br><br>Q: 133. Where does that ladder reach to?<br>A: To the Heavens.<br><br>Q: 134. What does it rest upon?<br>A: The Holy Bible.<br><br>Q: 135. Why on that Book?<br>A: Why the BIBLE Supports JACOB’s LADDER. By the Doctrines contained in the HOLY BIBLE, we are taught to believe in the Divine dispensation of Providence, which Belief strengthens our FAITH, and enables us to ascend the first Step. That FAITH naturally creates in us a HOPE, of becoming Partakers of some of the blessed Promises therein Recorded, which HOPE enables us to ascend the second Step. But the THIRD and LAST, being CHARITY, comprehends the WHOLE; and he who is possessed of this VIRTUE in its ample Sense, is said to have arrived to the Summit of his Profession, or more Metaphorically into an Ætherial Mansion, veiled from the mortal Eye, by the starry Firmament. And is further emblematically depicted in our lodge by seven stars which point out seven regular made masons, without which no lodge can be perfect nor can any person be regularly admitted into our masonic mysteries.</td>
