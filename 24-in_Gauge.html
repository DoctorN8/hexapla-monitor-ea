From the 24-inch gauge, therefore, we derive a lesson of daily admonition and instruction, for as it is divided into 24 equal parts it recals [sic] to our mind the divisions of the natural day into 24 hours, and which are apportioned to their proper objects, viz Prayer, Labour, refreshment and sleep. The 24-inch gauge, or rule directs us punctually to observe our duty, to press forward in the straight paths of virtue, neither inclining to the right nor the left for the sake of any transient amusement whatever or gratification whatever, but in all our actions to have eternity in view.</td>
